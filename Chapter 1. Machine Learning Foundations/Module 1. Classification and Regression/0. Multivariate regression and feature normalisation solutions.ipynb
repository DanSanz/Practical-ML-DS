    "### Input examples with multiple features\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's quickly remind ourselves how making predications for examples with a single feature works:\n",
    "1. the weight is a parameter of our model that controls how much the single feature affects the output\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case where our input examples have more than 1 feature, we proceed in a similar way, except for the fact that we will now have multiple model weights. Each of these weights controls the influence of the corresponding feature on the predicted model output. \n",
    "\n",
    "So\n",
    "- if a particular feature increasing usually correlates with an increase in the label, then the corresponding model weight should be **positive**. \n",
    "- if a particular feature decreasing usually correlates with a decrease in the label, then the corresponding model weight should be **negative**. \n",
    "- if a particular feature changing usually correlates with a negligible change in the label, then the corresponding model weight should be **negligible** (near zero).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding our own features to an example\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebooks, we have trained models to fit input-output relationships which are linear (straight lines). Because our models were linear models, they were able to fit this linear input-output relationships. But if the input-output relationship of the data was not linear, then these models would not be able to fit that relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another case where we might want to perform multivariate regression is where we want to add our own features to an example which currently only has a single feature. We might do this because we believe that the output label might be dependent on not just the feature available, but perhaps it's square value or another arbitrary transformation of it. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example imagine we have a dataset of the width of square floor-plan houses and we want to predict house price. You can imagine that the house price might be more likely to depend on the floor area rather than the square room width, and as such you may choose to add a quadratic term to your model by adding the square of the width as a feature to each example.\n",

The derivative of our cost w.r.t a particular weight is proportional to the value of that feature, the derivatives for the weight will be extremely high. If our learning rate is not low enough, this will lead to huge steps for that weight.
