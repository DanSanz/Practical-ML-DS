The size of the mini-batch is called the **batch size**. Mini-batches are commonly incorrectly referred to as batches, but it's not that deep. \n",

    "We can see here that stochastic and mini-batch training perform inference (making predictions) >3x faster and make updates 2.5x faster than full batch training. For larger datasets or inputs, these differences would be exaggerated even further. This is because the model has to pass the whole dataset forward to make a prediction and then compute the average gradient from every single one of those values to compute the weight and bias updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a larger dataset with more complex example features and/or labels, stochastic gradient descent may not converge, because single examples may rarely produce a gradient that is representative of an update that would reduce the error for all examples, rather than just this example.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "- gradient based optimisation is an optimisation technique based on iteratively adjusting the parameters of a model in the direction that will decrease the objective function\n",
    "- stochastic gradient descent is a robust and scalable way to train parametric models\n",
    "    - optimisation time scales linearly with the number of parameters\n",
    "- random search and grid search are far inferior to SGD & other gradient based optimisation techniques. Please don't use them again.\n",
    "- full batch training updates the parameters based on the gradient of the loss for all samples with respect to the model parameters\n",
    "- stochastic training updates the parameters based on the gradient of the loss for a single sample with respect to the model parameters\n",
    "- splitting our datasets into mini-batches can improve training speed\n",
    "    - less examples to process per update\n",
    "    - each update is based on a representative sample of the gradient to follow\n",
