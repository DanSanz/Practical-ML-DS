# Intro to PyTorch

## What is PyTorch?
- deep learning framework
- library for automatic differentiation
- builds computational graphs
- contains a lot of well implemented stuff that we don't have to write from scratch

## DEMONSTRATE implementation of linear regression in PyTorch

## Challenge: Have students IMPLEMENT the same linear regression from scratch

## Challenge: Have students IMPLEMENT binary classification using PyTorch
