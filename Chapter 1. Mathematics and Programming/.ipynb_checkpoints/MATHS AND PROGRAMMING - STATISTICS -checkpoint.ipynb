    "\n",
    "<p>Many Machine Learning and data science problems are either borrowed from or heavily rely on a theory from statistics. Some of the most incredible brains in AI and ML don't have a solid computer science degree but rather a beautiful understanding of statistics. So in this module we will be covering some of the concepts that we see reoccuring within ML and Data science.\n",

    "Again, I really encourage you to put aside any misconceptions your grade 9 stats classes seeded in your head about stats. It's an amazing aspect of maths and understanding it is becoming even more important in a post-covid environment.\n",
