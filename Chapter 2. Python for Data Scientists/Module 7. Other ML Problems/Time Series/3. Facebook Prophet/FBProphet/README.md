# Note on scope reduction:

Seeing as the Prophet section is shorter than initially envisaged, the prophet section will only have 1 notebook titled: Introduction to Prophet.
I'm considering doing a section 'extension' notebooks as well.

The intro notebook will have the following (reduced) skeleton:

1. what is facebook prophet
  - pros and cons
  - basic implementation (including converging forecasts)
  - seasonality
  - fourier order of fit
  - Model deployment, management and evaluation (includes model saving and loading too)
